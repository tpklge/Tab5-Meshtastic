/*
 * Tab5-Meshtastic v2 — BLE transport + sync engine (PRD §5 bottom layer).
 *
 * NimBLE central over the C6 (esp-hosted). Owns scan → bond → GATT discovery →
 * MTU → the poll/drain sync engine with read-timeout recovery and a self-
 * healing connection state machine. Decodes via mesh_proto and PUBLISHES into
 * app_state; it never touches LVGL.
 *
 * M1 connects to a fixed test radio (PRD §4 reference node). Runtime device
 * selection lands in M5.
 *
 * Ordering: the board must be powered (wlan_power) and esp_hosted_init() +
 * nimble_port_init() must have succeeded before ble_transport_start().
